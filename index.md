# 1. Assumptions and Dependencies 

It is assumed that all of the users devices are compatible with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with core specification version 4.0 and higher. This includes all iPhones 4s and higher, iPads generation 3 and higher, and any android devices version 4.3 and higher.

The application will only function within the limitations of the deviceâ€™s own capabilities. It is assumed that all users using Shout! need to be within at least 200 feet of at least one other person in order to engage in conversation.			
## 1.1 End User Characteristics
						
The application should eventually allow for upgrades, ie. features that can send gifs, and pictures
- Back-end migration abilities between iOS and Android 
- Clean and fast message updates, minimal lagging
- Buffers in place when there is an overflow of activity
- Easy to understand structure and design 
- Must work with no wifi or data connection

## 1.2 General Constraints

Shout is intended to allow people in close vicinity to chat to each other anonymously. This means that it must:
- Work on most modern smartphones, both Android and iOS
- Provide a secure enough connection to prevent data leakage from device to device

## 1.3 Goals and Guidelines

All design and code must be implemented and tested within the month-long deadline. All material that has been worked on, will be documented accordingly. Corresponding diagrams must be accurate and complete.

# 2. Architectural Strategies 
## 2.1 Reuse

There are no existing code components being used in this project.

## 2.2 Currently

Shout will make full use of Bluetooth Mesh Libraries rather than assembling each packet ourselves.

## 2.3 Future 

The application is versatile in its ability to update, enhance and create new features. The code should be primarily self-sufficient so maintenance should not be difficult.
